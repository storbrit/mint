# Mint

Mint is a Minecraft mod that makes some tiny changes that (hopefully) complement the vanilla experience.

## Features

- Augmented redstone: right-click a redstone wire with a blaze rod to augment it. Augmented redstone is blue and
  functions the same as normal redstone without connecting to it.
- Green apples that restore more hunger but less saturation
- Tool variants for stone types
    - Deepslate: same mining speed as stone, more durable
    - Netherrack: mining speed in between stone and iron but less durable

### Partially implemented

- Chocolate cakes that restore a lot of saturation but not much hunger

### Maybe at some point in the future

- Separation of splash bottles from normal bottles, instead of adding gunpowder to normal potions
- Aether / sky dimension (was initially going to be a part of a mod for larger features like this, but i don't have many
  ideas lol so i might merge those ideas into this mod)
