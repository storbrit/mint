# Mint

Mint is a Minecraft mod that makes some tiny changes that (hopefully) flush well with the vanilla experience.

## Features

### Partially implemented

- Green apples that restore more hunger but less saturation
- Chocolate cakes that restore a lot of saturation but not much hunger

### Planned

- Tool variants for every wood and stone type, and pigsteel if the pigsteel mod is installed

### Maybe at some point in the future

- Separate splash bottles from normal bottles with a custom crafting recipe to use instead of adding gunpowder to normal
